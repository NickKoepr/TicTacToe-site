## TicTacToe Terms of Service
****
When using the TicTacToe Discord bot on Discord, you agree to the Terms stated on this page and our Privacy Policy that you can find [here](/posts/privacy-policy/). The terms _“we”_ and _“our”_ represent NickKoepr, and the terms _“user”_ and _“you”_ represent the Discord user who makes use of the TicTacToe Discord bot or a person that is sending a data removal request, _“game”_ represent a game of tic tac toe that Discord users are playing with the TicTacToe Discord bot and _“data”_ represents the data that the TicTacToe Discord bot collects. We are not responsible for any spelling or grammar mistakes in this document.

1. **Availability**
   - The TicTacToe Discord bot is provided as-is.
   - We will not guarantee that the bot will be available in the future.
   - We will not guarantee that the bot will be online at the time the user wants to use the bot.
   - We will not guarantee that features inside the bot will always work as said.

2. **Content**
   - We are not responsible for showing content to a user that another user has given to the bot, such as the name of a user that a bot will display when playing a game.

3. **Security**
   - We will not guarantee, despite the fact that we take security very seriously, that our bot and our data will always be safe and secure.
   - We will not guarantee that the data from our bot will not be published to the public by a source that is not affiliated with NickKoepr (such as a data leak).

4. **Data**
   - A user can always make a request for a removal for data that has a direct link to a certain Discord server. The only data that has a direct link to a Discord server, is a custom prefix. The user that is sending a removal request, has to be the owner of the Discord server. To make a request for removal, please email to nickkkoepr\[at]duck\[dot]com with your Discord Server ID and prove that you are the server owner. We will remove the direct link to your server as quickly as possible.
   - We will not guarantee that there will not be any other data that has a direct link to the Discord Server, for which a user has requested a removal, in the future after the removal from the data when a user has made a request for data removal.

5. **Changes**
   - We can change our Terms of Service at any time without making an announcement for it.
